    You have another set of specific mapping functions:
        - flatMap
        - flatMapToInt
        - flatMapToDouble
        - flatMapToLong

    flatMap() takes the stream entries and returns another stream. All of the returned streams are merged into one
    single stream. You can use this single stream after the flatMap function.

    //TODO Use PersonLists.instance with flatMap. In the end you should print out each email address.

    API:
    <R> Stream<R> flatMap(Function<? super T, ? extends Stream<? extends R>> mapper);
